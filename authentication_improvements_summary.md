# Template Authentication & Authorization Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the authentication and authorization improvements implemented for the template system to ensure proper access control and data security.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Authorization Policies Applied

All template endpoints now have proper authorization policies:

- **`[Authorize(Policy = "AllRoles")]`** - Applied to:
  - `GET /templates` - Get all templates (filtered by role)
  - `GET /templates/{id}` - Get specific template (with access control)
  - `GET /templates/published` - Get published templates (organization-filtered)
  - `GET /templates/category/{category}` - Get templates by category (organization-filtered)
  - `GET /templates/assigned` - Get assigned templates

- **`[Authorize(Policy = "AdminOrManager")]`** - Applied to:
  - `GET /templates/user/{userId}` - Get templates by user
  - `POST /templates` - Create template
  - `PUT /templates/{id}` - Update template
  - `PUT /templates/{id}/publish` - Publish template
  - `POST /templates/{id}/version` - Create new version
  - `DELETE /templates/{id}` - Delete template

### 2. Role-Based Access Control

#### Administrator
- Can access ALL templates across all organizations
- Can create, update, publish, and delete any template
- Can view all published templates and categories

#### Manager
- Can access their own templates + published templates from their organization
- Can create, update, publish, and delete their own templates
- Can view published templates and categories from their organization only

#### Supervisor
- Can access ONLY published templates from their organization
- Cannot create, update, or delete templates
- Can view published templates and categories from their organization only

#### Auditor
- Can access ONLY templates assigned to them
- Cannot create, update, or delete templates
- Can only view templates they are assigned to work with

### 3. Organization-Based Filtering

All template queries now include organization-based filtering:

- **Published Templates**: Users only see published templates from their organization
- **Category Filtering**: Users only see templates by category from their organization
- **Assigned Templates**: Users only see templates assigned to them within their organization
- **Role-Based Templates**: All role-based queries respect organization boundaries

### 4. Enhanced Repository Methods

New overloaded methods added for better security:

```csharp
// Organization-filtered methods
GetPublishedTemplatesAsync(Guid userId)
GetTemplatesByCategoryAsync(string category, Guid userId)
```

### 5. Security Validations

#### Template Access Control
- Individual template access is validated based on user role and ownership
- Auditors can only access templates assigned to them
- Managers can access their own templates and published ones from their organization
- Supervisors can only access published templates from their organization

#### Template Creation Restrictions
- Only Administrators and Managers can create templates
- Auditors and Supervisors are explicitly prevented from creating templates via `[Authorize(Policy = "AdminOrManager")]`

#### Template Modification Restrictions
- Only template creators and administrators can update/publish/delete templates
- Published templates cannot be directly updated (must create new version)

## API Endpoint Security Summary

| Endpoint | Method | Authorization | Access Control |
|----------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| `/templates` | GET | AllRoles | Role-based filtering |
| `/templates/{id}` | GET | AllRoles | Individual access validation |
| `/templates/published` | GET | AllRoles | Organization-filtered |
| `/templates/category/{category}` | GET | AllRoles | Organization-filtered |
| `/templates/assigned` | GET | AllRoles | User's assignments only |
| `/templates/user/{userId}` | GET | AdminOrManager | Admin/Manager only |
| `/templates` | POST | AdminOrManager | Admin/Manager only |
| `/templates/{id}` | PUT | AdminOrManager | Creator/Admin only |
| `/templates/{id}/publish` | PUT | AdminOrManager | Creator/Admin only |
| `/templates/{id}/version` | POST | AdminOrManager | Creator/Admin only |
| `/templates/{id}` | DELETE | AdminOrManager | Creator/Admin only |

## Database Security

- All queries now include organization-based filtering
- User validation ensures users exist before processing requests
- Empty result sets returned for invalid users
- Proper foreign key relationships maintained

## Benefits

1. **Data Isolation**: Users can only access data from their organization
2. **Role-Based Access**: Clear separation of permissions based on user roles
3. **Auditor Security**: Auditors can only access assigned templates
4. **Template Protection**: Only authorized users can create/modify templates
5. **Organization Security**: Cross-organization data access prevented
6. **Audit Trail**: All access is properly authenticated and authorized

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test each role with various template access scenarios
2. Verify organization isolation works correctly
3. Test auditor access to assigned vs unassigned templates
4. Verify template creation/modification restrictions
5. Test cross-organization access prevention
6. Validate cascade deletion works with new security model
